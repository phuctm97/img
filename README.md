# ðŸŽ† Imagegen as a Service

Imagegen (image generator) as a Service, built with Next.js and Vercel.

## What is this?

This is an API that generates dynamic images for different purposes, is especially useful to generate cover images for distributing content:

- Blogging & writing.

- Videos' thumbnails.

- Open-source repositories' social images.

- etc.

It's built and deployed serverless thanks to Next.js and Vercel, so there is nothing to maintain. Moreover, thanks to Vercel's generous hobby plan, this is **completely free** for non-commercial use.

### Example

The above image is a dynamic image generated by this service, copy the URL below and paste on your browser to see it yourself:
